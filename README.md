# SoundCraftUi24R
Just a simple StreamDeck Plugin to control some functions of the SoundCraft Ui24R mixers.
Far from complete, for now you can only control Mutegroups, mute channels, solo channels, change Cues and Snapshots and the Dim button. 

More fuctions can be added pretty easily, but so far I did not need them.

The code is pretty ugly. It works, can run for a day without creating a blackhole and I am sure has many bad design descisions.

I am happy for any suggestion for improvement.

Oh, and be sure to edit the appsettings.json and change the IP to your mixer, if you try out the compiled plugin.
It's written in C# for .net5 so make sure you have the .net5 desktop runtime installed.
